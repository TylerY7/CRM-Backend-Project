# CRM-Backend-Project

A simple Go application that serves a customer management API and static HTML files. The API allows for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on customer data, while the static files (like an `index.html`) are served from a `static` folder. This project uses the `gorilla/mux` package for routing.
